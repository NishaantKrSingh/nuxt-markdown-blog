description: I'm a passionate web and backend developer with experience in building efficient, scalable, and user-friendly applications. My expertise spans modern web frameworks like Nuxt.js, Astro, and Node.js, alongside robust backend solutions using FastAPI, Flask, and Express.js. I've worked extensively with databases like Firebase, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, and enjoy developing solutions that balance performance with simplicity. My projects range from Chrome extensions for enhanced productivity to AI-powered systems like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) services. Beyond my professional work, I have a keen interest in creating projects with Arduino, exploring hardware innovations as a hobby. I also love sharing my knowledge through detailed codelabs and technical blogs, helping others navigate web development concepts in a structured, practical way.
